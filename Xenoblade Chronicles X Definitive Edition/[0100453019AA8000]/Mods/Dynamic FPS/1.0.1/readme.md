## Dynamic FPS BETA for v1.0.1

- **Made by [Fl4sh](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174)**

- **Working on Sudachi & Citron + Kenji-NX and Ryubing** 

- Mod is **running at 120FPS by default**. If you want 60FPS just delete the v2.pchtxt in the exefs folder

- You can still unlock the FPS upt to 120FPS even without v2.pchtxt

- **Mod is still WIP (Work In Progress)**

## What's fixed

- Qte working at all FPS
- Morale Level working at all FPS
- Fixed camera speed
- Fixed map speed
- Fixed grass/rain/cloud/fog/shooting speed

- Fixed some skills effect speed
- Fixed Overdrive duration
- Fixed buff/debuff duration
- Fixed death timer
- Locked most of the cutscenes to 60FPS (read notes below)

## Known Issues

- Locking some cutscenes avoid desync and other weird behaviors
- Cutscenes at 60FPS will jitter/flicker sometimes, its synced though
- Fixing those cutscenes softlock the game in other areas, so i leave it as it is
- Despite mod being dynamic, some timings may become erratic
- Jump works fine most of the time, but at 120fps+ it may vary
