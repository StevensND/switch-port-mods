2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`
