## Cheats Available

> [!NOTE]
**This is a cheat (.txt file) not an ExeFS mod** (.pchtxt file). Please don't confuse them. **They're not the same**

This cheat is a pointer cheat so it might not work on some emulator.

- **60FPS**: Internally, it's running at 60FPS, so any frame rate counter will indicate 60FPS.
 
The scroll camera is coded to run at 30FPS, as are the protagonist's sprite and the enemies. 

The problem is that there are other enemies and many elements on screen that are moving at 60FPS, so each frame is new. 

The logical thing would have been to lock the ENTIRE game at 30FPS if it had performance issues, but they chose to lock only some elements at 30FPS, and that is a complete disaster that in turn causes more performance issues. 

Note that the problem only occurs in the Switch version. The native PC version runs great on any PC and has ridiculously low requirements.
