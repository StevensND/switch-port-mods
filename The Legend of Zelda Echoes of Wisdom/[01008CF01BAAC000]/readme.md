## About FPS Drops

> [!NOTE]
CHECK THE **[FPS DROPS NOTES SECTION](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Echoes%20of%20Wisdom/%5B01008CF01BAAC000%5D/FPS%20Drops%20NOTES)** TO SEE GAMEPLAY IRL.

The game runs natively at 60FPS on Switch. However the game is using double buffer.

So if you're facing FPS drops and your FPS drops to 30 is due to that. 

If you're playing on Switch you can try to OC it and apply a good OC to stabilize the FPS.

We tried to do a mod to stabilize the FPS. However I'm not satisfied with the results yet (I think a triple buffer patch it's neccesary).

## Is the engine the same as Link's Awakening?

Let's say ... **yes and no**. Some of the functions have changed.

Therefore, some mods such as Disable DOF/Blur have had to be redone to fix bugs.

Some "modders" (if you can call them that because **they're not**) have made copy & paste of Link's Awakening mods hoping that everything will work the same but it's not like that.

## Did you test the mods on Switch or emulator?

I have only played it on Switch. However Fl4sh and the rest of the modders in the team have been playing in emulator.

Some of the mods in their early versions were not working as expected/properly, had visual glitches or the game didn't boot.

Thanks to this, we have been able to verify that the mods work properly on Switch and other emulators (Ryujinx in this case).

## XCI or NSP

![imagen](https://i.imgur.com/ALZ7inS.png)

You can use both formats. Just make sure that your Signature and Hash are **Valid** as I show in the screenshot above.

> [!NOTE]
Remember that **.XCI is a file dumped from the cartridge** while **.nsp is a dump from the eShop**

- .XCI: Dump from the cartdrige.
- .NSP: Dump from the eShop. The updates of the game must be in .nsp format.
- .NSZ: Is a .NSP file compressed like a .rar or .zip file.
- .XCZ: Is a .XCI file compressed like a .rar or .zip file.

## Emulator Instructions

**[VIDEO TUTORIAL HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij5fLfaZAWc)**

1. **Click on the folder of the version that you want to use**

Example: I would click on the 1.0.1 folder in this example.

Then **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**. 

Example: I would click on the Disable DOF-BLUR mod folder.

**Now click on the .pchtxt file.**

Finally move your mouse over the arrow icon and **click on it (Download Raw file)** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it 60fps for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder exefs. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be similar to this: `Disable DOF\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt files to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
