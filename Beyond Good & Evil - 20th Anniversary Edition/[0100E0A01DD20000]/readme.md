## IMPORTANT INFO

**Game Title**: Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition

**TitleID: 0100E0A01DD20000**

**[ALTERNATIVE DOWNLOAD LINK](https://gamebanana.com/mods/524805)**

> [!TIP]
You can disable/turn OFF Vsync or press Control U (for Yuzu + forks) or F1 (for Ryujinx) and set a FPS limit using RivaTuner or another alternative **instead**.

In addition if you use Yuzu and the forks, you can set the limit speed percent to 200 % and get 60FPS. If you set 400 % you will get 120FPS etc etc.

These mods I've made are intended for people who don't want or can't use these options.

> [!NOTE]
These mods shouldn't require an update and should work for all updates available.

I made these mods because several people asked me for it but **I have no interest in this game**.

> [!WARNING]
Loading screens are still running at 10-15FPS, so don't panic. 

It's not something I find annoying and I'm not going to waste my time fixing it either.

## FPS Mods Options Available:

- 60FPS (Set a limit of 60FPS).

- Uncap FPS (Allows to play above 60FPS). 

I don't know if there will be any problems with the mod above 60FPS, as I said before: I haven't played this game too much and I'm not interested in it.

## Instructions:

1. Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use. Then click on the .pchtxt file and finally click on the arrow icon (Download Raw File) to download the mod.
2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and `Open Mod Data Location` (Yuzu)/`Open Mods Directory` (Ryujinx).
3. Create a new folder in the directory you just opened and name it `60FPS` for instance. Open this folder and create another folder inside it. Name this new folder `exefs`. Finally open this last created folder and paste the corresponding .pchtxt file there.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\60FPS.pchtxt`

## Switch Users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
