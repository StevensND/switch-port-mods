## Game Info

**Title: Mario & Luigi: Brothership**

**TitleID: 01006D0017F7A000**

**Engine: Unreal Engine 4**

**[Gameplay (Played on Switch with OC), not emulated](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x98uilo)**

**[ALTERNATIVE DOWNLOAD LINK (GAMEBANANA)](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/20508)**

> [!WARNING]
Tested on Yuzu and Sudachi. **RYUJINX HAS ISSUES AND THE GAME CRASH AFTER 3-5 MINUTES EVEN WITHOUT MODS**.

> [!TIP]
There's a "fix" for Ryujinx but that will drop your FPS so it's up to you use it or NOT

Go to `Options` and then click on `Settings`. Then click on `CPU`. Finally change the `Memory Manager Mode` to `Software`

Another option could be the following (IMO this option works better and doesn't tank too much FPS):

Go to `Options` and then click on `Graphics`. Then click on `Graphics Backend Multithreading` and select `OFF`

## Mods Available

- **FPS**: 60FPS + Uncap FPS

- **Level Of Detail**

- **Resolution**: 1080p, 1440p (2K), 2160p (4K)

> [!NOTE]
You've to use Docked Mode for now **if you're going to use these resolution mods**

If you use Handheld mode, you'll see that the HUD overlay doesn't scale properly and it's not full screen

You can fix it by switch to Docked and then switching to Handheld again. **However the resolution will be the same**. This shouldn't happen. Wait for a fix.

- **Speed Hack**: If you want to advance text faster or move faster, just use it.

## Versions supported

- **1.0.0 | BuildID: 59874C9B530095AC**

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

Here is a [video guide](https://youtu.be/0X5g6HF7LB4?si=n-UtFAEAj2VtjEQQ) + [written guide](https://rentry.co/NSwitch60FPSLockerGuide) about FPSLocker

Here is a [written guide](https://rentry.co/howtoget60fps) about how to get 60FPS on Switch.

I uploaded some mods on IPS format too so you don't have to convert them.

## OLED Switch (Mariko) FPS Test

> [!NOTE]
My OC settings are on the gameplay video. However I higly suggest don't do copy & paste.

- 60FPS Only with Default Resolution (1600x900) = 45-50FPS in game. Reaching 60FPS on battles.

- 60FPS + 1080p Mod without OC =  32-35FPS. Reaching 45-60 on battle.

- 60FPS + 1080p Mod + LOD Mod with OC = Watch the gameplay video
