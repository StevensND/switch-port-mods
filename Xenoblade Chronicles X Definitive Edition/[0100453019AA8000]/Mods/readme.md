## Tracking the mods development

I won't do a Discord server for this. Just check these forums:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods/discussions/40)
- [GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-emulator-mods-cheats-discussion.668674/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/1jh1fvy/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition/)

~~Fuck you 4chan and your users asking for weird stuff~~

## How to download and install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/PVMZ6aGJ5z4?si=EHoJf-yQ1fqnYI7X)

> [!WARNING]
To use the FPS mod properly, you must use the cheat inside the `cheats` folder and the .pchtxt file inside `exefs` folder together.

Otherwise, the mod won't work properly. **KEEP IN MIND THAT THE FPS ARE NOT DYNAMIC** so if the FPS are not stable and goes below 60FPS, you'll notice slowdowns.

**Issues reported without the cheat enabled will be automatically ignored.**

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

Here is a [video guide](https://youtu.be/0X5g6HF7LB4?si=n-UtFAEAj2VtjEQQ) + [written guide](https://rentry.co/NSwitch60FPSLockerGuide) about FPSLocker

Here is a [written guide](https://rentry.co/howtoget60fps) about how to get 60FPS on Switch.

## Why there are two version of 60FPS

- **60FPS + 30FPS Cutscenes (WIP)**: 

This mod makes the gameplay run at 60FPS and keeps the cutscenes lock at 30FPS.

- **60FPS + 60FPS Real Time Cutscenes + 30FPS Pre-rendered Cutscenes (WIP)**:

This is mod is called `[60FPS (60-30FPS Cutscenes)]` on the .zip file.

It makes the game run at 60FPS on gameplay, 60FPS on real time cutscenes and 30FPS on pre-rendered cutscenes.

So if you're playing and you saw a cutscene running at 30FPS, that's a pre-rendered cutscene.
