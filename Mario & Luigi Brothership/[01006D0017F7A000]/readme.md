Fl4sh and I won't release resolutions mods **YET**

## About the mods leaked

I know the FPS mods were leaked on 4chan but meh. Fuck 4chan and their users.

Find things on that site is really a mess.

If you didn't find the FPS mods here there are.

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

> [!NOTE]
Check this [VIDEO GUIDE](https://youtu.be/ij5fLfaZAWc?si=kBf1FVzheZY5SMgz) to know how to download my mods **if the format is only .pchtxt**

Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

## Switch users

You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips
